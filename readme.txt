Welcome to my readme.txt file for this Assignment 2!

GT EMAIL: JMODI30@GATECH.EDU

LANGUAGE: PYTHON
METHOD: JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS

The code for each respective dataset is written in a separate file, to make it easier to process!
If you have Anaconda Navigator, all relevant libraries are already accessible and ready to use. If not, please take a look at the file labeled "pip-requirements.txt" (thanks to Varun Dave for the idea). 

**To run the code**

The setup:
Each of the three problems are setup in their own .ipynb: MaxKColor, Queens, KnapSack, and the Neural Networks.

Please set up an environment that supports .ipynb files. This could be Google Colab, Jupyter Notebooks, or the Anaconda Navigator environment. Then, on the top, clicks "Cells" > "Run All".

Code and all relevant graphs used in analysis can be found above. The link expires on November 22nd, 2023.

Because of the permitted usage of GenAI tools, I utilized ChatGPT to help answer questions about my datasets, as well as Sklearn's modules, and LaTex syntax for Overleaf. The link to my conversation is attached here: https://chat.openai.com/share/72d166a3-2068-47c1-b276-c9834d7d0288

Happy coding!
